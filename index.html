      <h2>Working for the common good</h2>
      <p>We want to fix the disintegration in the 
        relationship between local government and the people they 
        represent. The feeling of apathy many have towards local 
        issues. The inability of local government to reach and 
        listen to their constituents effectively. If you want to be 
        among the first to take action in your community Sign Up Now! </p>
